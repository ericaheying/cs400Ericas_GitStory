Once upon a time there was a princess named Kylie. She spent her days tending to her garden planting new flowers and weeding until one day something very terrible happened.

She forgot the password to her Github account! She tried again and again with different combinations, but nothing worked. 

She finally gave up and decided to reset her password but when she did, it said "cannot set new password
to old password"!

Kylie created a new account but lost all her repositories! Now she always backs them up on the cloud.

Now that Kylie is sure to back up her repositories to the cloud, she can live her days worry free. She can continue creating her digital garden without losing a single flower.
